          <Accordion.Panel>
            Excalidraw is very useful, but the free version doesn't let you have multiple saved drawings.
            So <Text span fw={900} c="light-dark(#2A2843, #9D99C2)">ExcaliHub</Text> was made to solve that problem.
            I needed it so I made it.

            My name is Nabil, I'm a software engineer. You can know more about me on
            my <Link href="https://nabilmansour.com/" target="_blank" style={{ textDecoration: "none" }}>

          <Accordion.Panel>
            Of course not. I am making this for myself but would probably use Excalidraw if I want all the fancy features.
            This is just to have multiple drawings saved in one place. I recommend using
            the <Link href="https://plus.excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" style={{ textDecoration: "none" }}>original Excalidraw</Link> platform
            if you want the other features.

          <Accordion.Panel>
            I don't. This is a free service and will always be free.
            I made this for myself and thought others might find it useful. That being said, if you want to support me, you can
