Excalihub is a platform for creating and sharing Excalidraw drawings. You can create, save, and share multiple drawings for free.

You can checkout the live app at https://excalihub.dev/

## Getting Started

To get started with ExcaliHub, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NabilNYMansour/excalihub
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd excalihub
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run:
```bash
npm start
```

## Purpose

I find Excalidraw useful but the free version doesn't let you have multiple saved drawings. So I thought I could make that myself.
